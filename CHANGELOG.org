* Development

- Add =corfu-infoframe= extension to display candidate documentation and location
  in a small child frame next to the candidate menu. This extension has been
  contributed by Yuwei Tian who assigned copyright to the FSF. The extension
  supersedes Yuwei's =corfu-doc= package.
- Extract the =corfu-echo= extension from =corfu.el=. In order to see echo
  messages, enable =corfu-echo-mode=. You probably want to enable either
  =corfu-echo-mode= or =corfu-infoframe-mode=.
- Rename =corfu-echo-documentation= to =corfu-echo-delay=.

* Version 0.28 (2022-10-16)
