* Introduction

Corfu provides a completion overlay for the default completion in region
function. The current candidates are shown in a popup overlay below or above the
point. Corfu can be considered the minimalistic completion-in-region counterpart
of Vertico.

Icomplete provides both completion-in-region and minibuffer completion in a
single package. While Corfu and Vertico are technically similar to Icomplete,
Corfu and Vertico are two separate packages in order to optimize the UI for the
two distinct use cases, also leading to code bases which are easier to
understand.

Corfu is a minimal package of less than 500 lines of code (my arbitrary limit
for small components providing a single specific feature). In contrast to the
featureful and complex Company package, Corfu only provides the completion
UI. No custom backends are provided. The completions are provided by the
~completion-at-point-functions~. However many code completion backends provide
~completion-at-point-functions~, such that relying only on the default
completion may often be sufficient.

* Features

- Popup display with scrollbar indicator and arrow key navigation
- The popup must be summoned explicitly by =TAB=
- The current candidate is inserted with =TAB= and selected with =RET=
- Candidates sorting by prefix, string length and alphabetically
- Completion is automatically left after candidate selection
- Filter string can contain arbitrary characters and spaces (needed
  when filtering with the [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][Orderless]] completion style)

* Configuration

Corfu must be installed manually as of now. After installation, the local minor
mode can be enabled with =M-x corfu-mode=. In order to configure Corfu and other
packages in your init.el, you may want to use ~use-package~. I recommend to give
orderless completion a try, which is different from the familiar prefix TAB
completion. Here is an example configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Enable TAB completion
  (use-package emacs
    :init
    (setq tab-always-indent 'complete))

  ;; Configure corfu
  (use-package corfu
    ;; Optionally use TAB for cycling, default is `corfu-complete'.
    ;; :bind (:map corfu-map
    ;;        ("TAB" . corfu-next)
    ;;        ("S-TAB" . corfu-previous))

    ;; Enable the overlay only for certain modes.
    ;; For example it is not a useful UI for completions at point in the
    ;; minibuffer.
    :hook ((prog-mode . corfu-mode)
           (eshell-mode . corfu-mode))

    ;; Optionall enable cycling for `corfu-next' and `corfu-previous'.
    ;; (setq corfu-cycle t)
  )

  ;; Use the `orderless' completion style.
  ;; Enable `partial-completion' for files to allow path expansion.
  ;; You may prefer to use `initials' instead of `partial-completion'.
  (use-package orderless
    :init
    (setq completion-styles '(orderless)
          completion-category-defaults nil
          completion-category-overrides '((file (styles . (partial-completion))))))
#+end_src

* Complementary packages

Corfu works well together with all packages providing code completion via the
~completion-at-point-functions~. Furthermore it supports various completion
styles, including the advanced [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][Orderless]] completion style, where the filtering
expressions are separated by spaces.

You may also want to look into my [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]] package, which provides a vertical
minibuffer completion system. Vertico is the minibuffer counterpart of Corfu.
